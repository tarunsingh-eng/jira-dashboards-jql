Practical JQL filters used for Jira dashboards (PM, QA, Scrum, Executives)

This repository contains **production-ready JQL filters** used to build
real Jira dashboards for:

- QA & Test Leads
- Scrum Masters
- Project / Delivery Managers
- Product Managers
- Executives

These JQLs are **decision-driven**, not demo queries.

## How to use
1. Open the relevant role folder
2. Download the PDF
3. Copy the JQL directly into Jira filters
4. Replace project 'KEY' with your own project key (if applicable)
5. Use them in dashboards or reports
